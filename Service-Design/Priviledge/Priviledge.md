| Service Summary | The **Privilege Service** is responsible for managing member **tiers**, **benefits**, and **point conversion rules** in a dynamic and configurable way. It supports flexible tier progression (automatic, manual, or via invitation), benefit mapping, and real-time rule evaluation. The service integrates with **IAM**, **Campaign**, **Mission**, and **Point** microservices, enabling organizations to configure member privileges and reward logic without code redeployment. |

## 0. Change History

- **28-Oct-2025:** - Ittikorn Sopawan  
  - **Version:** 1.0.0  
  - **Change / Notes:**  
    - Initial draft of Privilege Service Specification. Defined dynamic tier model, rule engine, integrations, and configuration workflow.

## 1. Service Name

> **Privilege Service â€” Member Tier & Benefit Management**

This microservice provides a configurable framework to manage membership tiers, benefits, and reward calculation logic.  
It acts as the decision and rules engine that determines how a memberâ€™s actions or transactions translate into privileges and benefits within the ecosystem.

---

## 2. Purpose

The **Privilege Service** enables businesses to design and operate dynamic loyalty programs without redeploying code.  
It defines how members earn, maintain, and upgrade their status based on transactional and behavioral data from multiple integrated services.

### Key Objectives:
- Allow flexible **Tier configurations** (automatic progression, manual assignment, invitation-based, or immutable tiers).  
- Support **Benefit catalog management** for mapping privileges such as discounts, point multipliers, vouchers, or access rights.  
- Manage **Point conversion rules**, including time-based or campaign-based modifiers.  
- Automate **Tier promotion and demotion** decisions based on configurable business rules.  
- Integrate seamlessly with **IAM**, **Campaign**, **Mission**, and **Point** services.  
- Provide **Admin and Simulation APIs** for business users to preview and validate configurations before deployment.  

---

## 3. Conceptual Workflow

The Privilege Service operates as an **event-driven rules engine**.  
It listens to events from transactions, mission completions, campaign redemptions, invitations, and event codes to determine member tier upgrades/downgrades, benefit allocations, and point calculations.  

It then propagates updates to connected microservices (IAM, Point, Notification) and logs all actions for auditing purposes.

## 3. Conceptual Workflow

The **Privilege Service** operates as a **centralized, event-driven engine** for managing **member tiers, benefits, and point calculations**.  
It evaluates events from multiple sources, applies configurable rules, updates member states, and triggers notifications or point assignments.  

This workflow explains **how tiers behave**, **how benefits are applied**, **how points are calculated**, and **how the system ensures consistency**.

---

### 3.1 Member Event Flow

This flow handles **user-triggered events** that may affect tiers, benefits, or points.

#### 3.1.1. **Event Reception**

- Listens to events: `transaction.completed`, `mission.completed`, `campaign.redeemed`, `event_code.redeemed`.
- Each event includes metadata: `user_id`, `amount`, `timestamp`, `campaign_id`, `payment_method`, etc.
- Events are **queued** for asynchronous processing to ensure scalability.

#### 3.1.2. **Fetch Member Profile**

- Queries IAM Service for:  
  - Current Tier (`tier_id`)  
  - Current points and benefit eligibility  
  - Historical activity (for accumulative rules)

#### 3.1.3. **Evaluate Tier Rules**

- Check **Promotion Rules**:
  - Accumulative spend thresholds
  - Points earned
  - Transaction count
  - Mission or campaign completions
- Check **Demotion Rules**:
  - Inactivity period
  - Rule violation (optional)
- Check **Invitation / Event Code Rules**:
  - Admin-invited tier upgrade
  - Event-code triggered promotion
- **Immutable tiers** cannot be upgraded/demoted.

#### 3.1.4. **Evaluate Benefit Rules**

- Determine benefits eligible for the current tier:
  - Discount percentages
  - Free shipping
  - Cashback
  - Priority support
  - Event or campaign access
  - Point multipliers
- Check **time-bound modifiers** or **campaign-specific benefits**.

#### 3.1.5. **Evaluate Point Conversion**

- Apply base point conversion (e.g., 100 THB â†’ 1 point).
- Apply **tier multiplier** (e.g., Gold = 1.2x).
- Apply **time/campaign modifiers** (e.g., X2 points during promotion period).
- Validate against any **daily/monthly caps**.

#### 3.1.6. **Apply Changes**

- Update **Member Tier** in IAM Service (if promoted/demoted).  
- Send **points** to Point Service.  
- Assign **benefits** internally or trigger external notifications.  
- Emit **events** for downstream microservices (`tier.changed`, `benefit.applied`, `points.applied`).  

#### 3.1.7. **Audit & Logging**

- Store complete audit log: `who`, `what`, `when`, `why`, `source_event_id`.
- Enables rollback if a transaction is reversed.

```

### 3.2 Tier Behavior & Lifecycle

- Dynamic Tier Creation
- Admin can create new tiers on the fly.
  - Define:
    - tier_name, rank, climbable, immutable, default_benefits
    - Accumulative spend thresholds, point thresholds
    - Allowed promotion/demotion rules
- Tier Progression
  - Automatic: Users accumulate points or complete tasks â†’ system evaluates rules â†’ upgrade/downgrade tier.
  - Manual / Invitation: Admin can assign tier directly or via invitation code.
  - Event Code Triggered: Specific promotions can push a member to a higher tier.
- Tier Restrictions
  - Immutable Tiers: Certain tiers cannot be changed.
  - Climbable Flag: Defines if tier can be promoted/demoted.
  - Promotion Window: Only valid during certain dates (campaign-specific).
- Benefit Mapping
  - Each tier maps to multiple benefits.
  - Benefits can have:
    - Quantity limits
    - Time-bound validity
    - Conditional logic (e.g., only apply if transaction > 1000 THB)

### 3.3 Admin Configuration Flow

- Admin accesses Portal / API.
- Can Create / Edit / Delete:
  - Tiers
  - Benefits
  - Promotion / Demotion Rules
- Simulation Engine:
  - Admin can simulate:
    - What tier a member would achieve given a set of transactions
    - Benefits eligibility
    - Points calculation
- Rule Validation:
  - Prevent conflicts (e.g., tier promotion loop, overlapping time modifiers)
  - Auto-check thresholds

    API --> DB["Privilege DB (tiers, rules, benefits)"]
    API --> Sim["Rule Simulation Engine"]
    Sim --> API
    API --> EventBus["Event Bus: promotion/benefit events"]
```

### 3.4 Point Conversion & Benefit Application Flow

1. Receive transaction/milestone event
2. Determine base points
3. Apply tier multiplier
4. Apply time/campaign modifier
5. Update Point Service
6. Evaluate benefit eligibility
7. Assign benefits or trigger notifications
8. Record audit

### 3.5 Event Propagation & Notification

- Event Bus publishes:
  - tier.changed
  - points.applied
  - benefit.assigned
- Subscribers (Notification Service, CRM, Frontend) update UI or send messages.
- Supports async retries and dead-letter queue for failed events.

### 3.6 Audit & Reconciliation

- Every tier change, benefit assignment, and point transaction is logged.
- Provides reconciliation jobs to verify:
  - Tier assignments
  - Points consistency
  - Benefit allocation
- Supports rollback for refunded/canceled transactions.

## 9. Ubiquitous Language

This section defines all key terms used in the **Privilege Service**.  
It provides a shared vocabulary for **BA, SA, DEV, and Business Stakeholders**.

| Term                         | Meaning / Definition                                                         | Description / Notes                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier**                     | Membership level assigned to a user (Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond)        | Determines benefits, point multipliers, promotion/demotion rules, and privilege access                          |
