| Service Summary | The **Privilege Service** is responsible for managing member **tiers**, **benefits**, and **point conversion rules** in a dynamic and configurable way. It supports flexible tier progression (automatic, manual, or via invitation), benefit mapping, and real-time rule evaluation. The service integrates with **IAM**, **Campaign**, **Mission**, and **Point** microservices, enabling organizations to configure member privileges and reward logic without code redeployment. |

## 0. Change History

- **31-Oct-2025:** - Ittikorn Sopawan  
  - **Version:** 1.0.0  
  - **Change / Notes:**  
    - Update topic 3 with workflow.
- **28-Oct-2025:** - Ittikorn Sopawan  
  - **Version:** 1.0.0  
  - **Change / Notes:**  
    - Initial draft of Privilege Service Specification. Defined dynamic tier model, rule engine, integrations, and configuration workflow.

## 1. Service Name

> **Privilege Service â€” Member Tier & Benefit Management**

This microservice provides a configurable framework to manage membership tiers, benefits, and reward calculation logic.  
It acts as the decision and rules engine that determines how a memberâ€™s actions or transactions translate into privileges and benefits within the ecosystem.

---

## 2. Purpose

The **Privilege Service** enables businesses to design and operate dynamic loyalty programs without redeploying code.  
It defines how members earn, maintain, and upgrade their status based on transactional and behavioral data from multiple integrated services.

### Key Objectives

- Allow flexible **Tier configurations** (automatic progression, manual assignment, invitation-based, or immutable tiers).  
- Support **Benefit catalog management** for mapping privileges such as discounts, point multipliers, vouchers, or access rights.  
- Manage **Point conversion rules**, including time-based or campaign-based modifiers.  
- Automate **Tier promotion and demotion** decisions based on configurable business rules.  
- Integrate seamlessly with **IAM**, **Campaign**, **Mission**, and **Point** services.  
- Provide **Admin and Simulation APIs** for business users to preview and validate configurations before deployment.  

---

## 3. Conceptual Workflow

Overview of the conceptual workflow of the Privilege Service, covering member onboarding, event reception, rule evaluation, point calculation, benefit application, and auditing/error handling.

**Summary:**  
The Privilege Service acts as a centralized, event-driven engine for managing member tiers, benefits, and points. It evaluates events from multiple sources, applies configurable rules, updates member states, and triggers notifications or point assignments, ensuring consistency and scalability across the system.

---

### 3.1 Member Onboarding Flow

The process for new members to create a profile, assign default tiers/privileges, and receive initial points or benefits.

- 3.1.1 Registration & Initialization â€“ Create a new member account and initialize basic profile data.  
- 3.1.2 Profile Linking with IAM â€“ Link the member profile with the IAM system for authentication and access control.  
- 3.1.3 Privilege Assignment â€“ Assign default tier, tier onboarding, and tier benefits via Privilege Microservice.  
- 3.1.4 Welcome Bonus / Initial Points â€“ Grant initial points or welcome benefits to the member.  
- 3.1.5 Event Emission (`member.created`) â€“ Emit an event to notify other systems (Campaign-Coupon, Point, Campaign-Product) about the new member.

| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier Management**                  | Create, update, delete tiers dynamically. Configure rank, climbable/immutable flags, thresholds, and default benefits. Automatically evaluates promotion/demotion based on rules.  |
| **Benefit Management**               | Define benefits (discounts, vouchers, priority support, point multipliers) and map them to tiers. Support time-bound and conditional application.                                  |

---

## 6. Non-Goals

- Not responsible for processing or storing raw financial transactions.
- Does not manage loyalty point ledger persistence.
- Not responsible for authentication or user identity management (delegated to IAM).
- Will not provide front-end UI components (focus on API and event-driven backend).
- Does not enforce business logic outside of tier, benefit, and point rules.

---

## 7. Data-Driven Decision Making

The system collects and structures detailed data on member activities, tier changes, benefits, and points. This data can be leveraged for:

- **Performance Analytics:** Track engagement, retention, and redemption rates across different tiers and campaigns.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Analyze member behavior patterns to identify high-value segments or predict churn.
- **Campaign Effectiveness:** Measure the impact of campaigns, promotions, and benefit programs on member activity.
- **Rule Optimization:** Refine promotion/demotion rules or benefit allocation strategies based on historical outcomes.
- **Forecasting & Predictive Modeling:** Use trends in points accrual, tier progression, and event participation to forecast future behavior.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Support targeted offers or benefits for members based on their activity and tier.
- **Reporting & Dashboards:** Provide actionable insights to management for strategy and operational decision-making.
