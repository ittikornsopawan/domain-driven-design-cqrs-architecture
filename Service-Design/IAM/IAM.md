## 1. Service Name

> **Identity & Access Management (IAM) Service**

## 2. Purpose

The **IAM Service** serves as the **centralized identity layer** for the entire platform, designed to provide a unified, secure, and extensible foundation for user authentication, authorization, and identity federation across all internal and external products.

### Core Objectives

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
   - Provide seamless login across all platform products with a single authentication session.
   - Reduce redundant login processes and password fatigue.
   - Improve user experience through centralized session handling and token propagation.

2. **Attribute-Based User Profile**
   - Maintain a **centralized directory** of user data in an **attribute-based model**.
   - Allow each product to define custom attributes (e.g., department, project_id, employee_code) without impacting the global schema.
   - Support dynamic attribute synchronization between systems (e.g., HR, Project, Vendor).

3. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
   - Implement fine-grained, **context-aware access control** policies.
   - Grant or restrict access based on user, resource, and environment attributes.
   - Automatically adjust permissions when user attributes (e.g., department, role, or tenant) change.

4. **Federation & External Authentication**
   - Support standard identity protocols (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SAML 2.0).
   - Act as an **Identity Broker** between external identity providers (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Azure AD) and internal systems.
   - Allow both directions of federation:
     - External login via external providers (e.g., “Login with Google”)
     - IAM acting as an authentication provider for partner systems (“Login with Platform Account”).

5. **Multi-Tenant Identity Layer**
   - Isolate user and policy data per organization (tenant).
   - Support cross-tenant users and tenant-level policy management.
   - Enable partner and vendor integrations under secure tenant boundaries.

6. **Audit, Compliance, and Observability**
   - Record all authentication, authorization, and attribute modification events.
   - Provide full traceability for compliance with PDPA, GDPR, and ISO27001.
   - Integrate with centralized monitoring and SIEM tools for proactive security analytics.

### Vision Alignment

> IAM is the **foundation of the entire ecosystem**, ensuring that all products share a unified, compliant, and scalable identity framework that supports both current and future business growth.

---

## 3. Conceptual Workflow

The IAM Service functions as the **core identity orchestration layer** that governs how every entity (user, system, or service) is authenticated, authorized, and governed within the platform.  
It enables **federation**, **multi-tenancy**, **policy-driven access**, and **compliance-grade auditability** across the entire ecosystem.

### 3.1 Concept Overview

IAM operates as a **central trust authority** and **policy enforcement hub**, integrating with:

- Internal microservices (e.g., HR, Project, Vendor, Subscription)
- External systems (e.g., Google Workspace, Azure AD, SSO partners)
- Platform SDKs (used by all frontend/backends)

It provides both **synchronous APIs** (REST/gRPC) and **event-driven communication** for continuous identity updates and audit trails.

IAM Core Domains:

1. **Authentication & Federation Gateway**
2. **Authorization & Policy Engine (ABAC)**
3. **Multi-Tenant Context Isolation**
4. **Attribute Management & Dynamic Grouping**
5. **Audit, Compliance & Observability**
6. **Integration APIs & SDK Layer**

Each domain contributes to a unified identity experience and ensures scalable governance across the ecosystem.

### 3.2 End-to-End Flow (System Narrative)

1. **Access Request**
   - A user or system initiates access to a tenant-specific application (e.g., HRMS, FlowerFlow).
   - The application redirects to IAM `/authorize` endpoint with `client_id` and `tenant_id`.

2. **Tenant Context Resolution**
   - IAM determines tenant boundary from the request (domain, subdomain, or header).
   - Loads tenant-specific configurations:
     - Branding
     - MFA settings
     - Federation options
     - Policy namespace
     - Attribute schema extensions

3. **Identity Verification**
   - IAM authenticates user via one of the following:
     - Local credentials (username/password)
     - OTP or passwordless link (email, SMS)
     - External identity via Federation Gateway (Google, AzureAD, etc.)
     - Service account / API key for backend integration
   - MFA or adaptive rules (geo, IP, device) may trigger secondary verification.

4. **Token Generation**
   - IAM issues a combination of:
     - **ID Token** – identity & claims
     - **Access Token** – scope & permissions
     - **Refresh Token** – renews sessions
   - Tokens are **signed per-tenant via KMS** and **tracked for revocation** in Redis/DB.

5. **Session Establishment**
   - The frontend receives tokens and stores them in secure storage (cookie, memory).
   - Applications use Access Token to interact with other microservices.

6. **Policy Evaluation (Authorization Phase)**
   - When a service receives a request with an Access Token:
     - It validates token via IAM `/introspect` endpoint.
     - Sends policy evaluation request to `/policy/evaluate`.
   - The **Policy Engine** performs:
     - Attribute lookup (from IAM or linked services)
     - Rule evaluation (JSON/YAML ABAC policy)
     - Decision response (Permit / Deny / Conditional)

7. **Audit Emission**
   - Every event (auth success, token issue, policy evaluation, federation handshake) emits an audit event → **Audit Service**
   - Event schema: `{ event_type, actor, target, result, timestamp, tenant_id, trace_id }`
   - Stored for compliance (PDPA/GDPR/ISO) and searchable in SIEM.

8. **Observability Loop**
   - Metrics (auth latency, token error rate, MFA failure, federation delay) exported to Prometheus/Grafana
   - Alerts configured for anomaly detection (e.g., failed login spikes, unusual federation patterns).

### 3.3 Authentication Domain

#### 3.3.1 Supported Authentication Modes

- Username/Password (BCrypt/Argon2)
- OTP / Passwordless via Email or SMS
- Social Login (Google, Facebook)
- Enterprise Federation (AzureAD, Okta, LDAP)
- Service Account (Machine-to-Machine)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (TOTP / WebAuthn / Push)

#### 3.3.2 Authentication Lifecycle

1. App → `/authorize`
2. IAM → Challenge (credential or external redirect)
3. User verifies credentials → returns auth code
4. IAM → `/token` issues tokens
5. Application → uses access token for APIs
6. IAM monitors session lifetime, rotation, and revocation

#### 3.3.3 Federation Gateway

- **Inbound:** accept external identities (SSO)
- **Outbound:** expose IAM as OIDC/SAML IdP
- **Token Mapping:** normalize external claims to IAM’s attribute schema
- **JIT Provisioning:** auto-create user profiles on first login

### 3.4 Authorization Domain (ABAC Policy Engine)

#### 3.4.1 Policy Evaluation Flow

1. Resource service requests decision `/policy/evaluate`
2. IAM loads:
   - User attributes
   - Resource metadata
   - Environment context
3. Policy Engine checks JSON/YAML rules
4. Returns `Permit`, `Deny`, or `Conditional`
5. Decision cached with TTL for performance

#### 3.4.2 Example Policy Definition

```yaml
policy:
  id: "document-view-access"
  description: "Allow managers to view documents in their department"
  effect: permit
  condition:
    and:
      - equals: [ user.department, resource.department ]
      - in: [ user.role, ["Manager", "Admin"] ]
```

### 3.4.3 ABAC Features

- Policy versioning and rollback
- Tenant-level isolation
- Real-time policy update propagation
- Integration with external context providers (HRMS, Project Service)

### 3.5 Multi-Tenant Context Management

#### 3.5.1 Tenant Scoping

- Each tenant has:
  - Unique namespace for users, roles, policies, and attributes
  - Separate encryption keys (KMS)
  - Configurable authentication providers

#### 3.5.2 Cross-Tenant Access

- Delegation Policy:
  - Allows user from Tenant A to access Tenant B’s resources under scoped token
- Full audit traceability with `origin_tenant_id` and `target_tenant_id`

#### 3.5.3 Tenant Lifecycle

- Onboarding → creates IAM tenant config, namespace, keys
- Offboarding → disables tenant endpoints and revokes tokens

### 3.6 Attribute & Group Management

#### 3.6.1 Attribute Directory

- Central user attribute store (JSONB / NoSQL)
- Supports schema extension and custom fields
- Attributes linked to ABAC and SSO federation mapping

#### 3.6.2 Dynamic Grouping

- Rules auto-assign users into groups

```yaml
  group: "Project Admins"
  rule:
    equals: [ user.project_role, "Admin" ]
```

- Groups can trigger dynamic permission sets or notifications

### 3.6.3 Sync & Propagation

- Periodic attribute sync from HR / CRM / Project services
- Supports webhook and event-driven updates

### 3.7 Audit & Compliance Flow

#### 3.7.1 Event Generation

Every IAM event produces:

- Authentication attempt
- Token lifecycle event
- Policy evaluation result
- Federation handshake
- Tenant admin changes

#### 3.7.2 Audit Pipeline

- **Alerts:** SIEM integration for unusual access
- **Zero Trust Compatibility:** Supports continuous verification and behavioral anomaly detection
- **Traceability:** OpenTelemetry tracing through all auth flows

### 3.10 End-to-End Sequence (Narrative Summary)

1. **User** → **Application** → redirect to **IAM Auth Gateway**  
2. IAM authenticates (local/federated) → issues tokens  
3. **Application** → **API Service** → validates token via IAM  
4. IAM evaluates ABAC policy → returns authorization decision  
5. IAM emits audit & metrics → **Audit + SIEM**  
6. IAM auto-syncs user attributes across tenants (if applicable)

> This lifecycle represents the **trusted identity pipeline**:  
> *Authenticate → Authorize → Federate → Audit → Govern → Observe*

### 3.11 Summary

IAM orchestrates all identity interactions in the ecosystem with:

- **Unified Authentication & SSO**
- **Policy-Based Authorization (ABAC)**
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
- **Federation & External Identities**
- **Dynamic Attribute Profiles**
- **Complete Audit & Compliance Coverage**
- **Integrated SDK & Observability**

This design ensures a **secure, scalable, and adaptive** identity framework that supports enterprise-grade operations across multiple tenants and products.

## 5. Service Scope

The IAM (Identity & Access Management) system acts as the **centralized identity and access layer** for all internal platform products and external partner systems. It covers the following core service functions:

### 5.1 Authentication

**Pain Points Before IAM:**

- Users need to remember multiple passwords
- Repeated logins for different systems
- MFA/OTP processes are fragmented and inconsistent

**Business Benefits After IAM:**

- Single Sign-On (SSO) across all systems
- Centralized Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and passwordless login
- Support for organizational login accounts (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, SAML/OIDC)

**Example Use Cases:**

- Employee logs into Project Management system and immediately accesses E-Sign and HRMS without re-login
- External partner uses Microsoft 365 account to log into the Platform without creating a new account

**User Quote:**
> “Now I can log in once and use every system without remembering multiple passwords.”

### 5.2 User Profile & Attribute Management

**Pain Points Before IAM:**

- User data scattered across multiple systems
- Difficult to add system-specific fields
- Attributes inconsistent across products

**Business Benefits After IAM:**

- Centralized Attribute Directory
- Support for Core, Custom, and System-defined Attributes
- Real-time synchronization of user attributes across systems

**Example Use Cases:**

- HR adds “employee_code” attribute; other products can access it via IAM
- Project Management system retrieves user roles from IAM instead of storing locally

**User Quote:**
> “User data is centralized and automatically updated, making it instantly accessible.”

### 5.3 Authorization & ABAC

**Pain Points Before IAM:**

- Repeated creation of roles/groups in multiple systems
- Manual permission adjustments
- Difficult to implement ABAC or context-aware authorization

**Business Benefits After IAM:**

- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Automatic permission adjustments when user attributes change
- Centralized, tenant-aware, context-aware policy management

**Example Use Cases:**

- Users with role=manager can approve documents in their department
- Users in department=HR access employee data for their tenant only

**User Quote:**
> “IAM automatically adjusts permissions based on my role, reducing admin workload.”

### 5.4 Dynamic Group Management

**Pain Points Before IAM:**

- Manual addition of members to groups
- Permission updates required when user data changes

**Business Benefits After IAM:**

- Groups created and updated automatically based on attributes
- Groups can drive policy or access control
- Reduces errors and speeds up administration

**Example Use Cases:**

- Employee moves from HR → Finance; IAM updates permissions automatically
- Group "Project Admins" auto-updates based on project_id attribute

### 5.5 Federation & External Authentication

**Pain Points Before IAM:**

- Multiple accounts needed for partners
- SSO and OAuth integration challenging

**Business Benefits After IAM:**

- Supports identity federation (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, SAML, OIDC)
- Acts as an Identity Broker for internal platform or partner systems
- Users can choose to log in with organizational accounts

**Example Use Cases:**

- Partner selects “Login with Microsoft 365” → IAM validates → issues platform token

**Partner Quote:**
> “I can use my company’s Google account to access the platform without creating a new account.”

### 5.6 Multi-Tenant & Tenant Isolation

**Pain Points Before IAM:**

- User data from different organizations mixed together
- Users unable to access multiple tenants safely

**Business Benefits After IAM:**

- Separate databases and policies per tenant
- Supports multi-tenant users
- Synchronizes attributes/roles between tenants securely

**Example Use Cases:**

- Company A and B use the same platform, but data is isolated
- Multi-tenant users can switch tenants without permission conflicts

### 5.7 Audit & Compliance

**Pain Points Before IAM:**

- No centralized audit log
- Hard to track access history
- Difficult to generate compliance reports

**Business Benefits After IAM:**

- Centralized logging for login, token, attribute, and policy events
- Supports PDPA / GDPR / ISO27001 compliance
- Logs can be exported to external SIEM systems

**Example Use Cases:**

- Audit who accessed what data, when, and from which tenant
- Generate compliance reports automatically

**Compliance Team Quote:**
> “All access and changes are traceable, making PDPA audits and security reviews much easier.”

## 6. Non-Goals

The IAM Service is designed to provide centralized identity and access management for the platform. However, there are specific areas and responsibilities that are **explicitly out of scope** for this service, to ensure clear boundaries and alignment with platform requirements:

1. **No Storage or Management of Business-Specific Data**
   - IAM does **not** store, process, or manage business or application-specific data such as project content, business documents, transactional records, or any domain data unrelated to user identity, attributes, or access control.
   - **Reason:** Business data remains the responsibility of each product or service domain to ensure proper data segregation, compliance, and scalability. IAM focuses strictly on user, attribute, and access information.

2. **No End-User Application UI**
   - IAM does **not** provide user-facing application interfaces (e.g., web portals, mobile apps, dashboards) for end users to interact directly with their accounts.
   - **Reason:** All user interfaces are developed and managed by consuming products. IAM exposes APIs and SDKs for integration, but UI/UX is handled by each application to meet product-specific requirements.

3. **Not a General-Purpose Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Provider**
   - IAM does **not** act as a standalone, universal MFA/2FA service for arbitrary external systems or as a generic OTP delivery platform.
   - **Reason:** IAM integrates with external, specialized MFA/2FA providers (e.g., SMS/email OTP gateways, authenticator apps, or third-party services) and orchestrates MFA flows as part of authentication, but does not offer MFA as an independent service for use outside of IAM-managed identity flows.

4. **No Storage of Highly Sensitive Financial Data**
   - IAM does **not** store, process, or manage sensitive financial or payment data such as credit card numbers, bank account details, or PCI-regulated data.
   - **Reason:** Handling such data requires compliance with additional regulatory standards (e.g., PCI DSS) and is outside the scope of IAM, which is focused on identity, authentication, and authorization data only.

5. **No Fine-Grained In-App Permission Management**
   - IAM does **not** manage or enforce detailed, application-specific UI permissions, feature toggles, or workflow-level access within individual product modules.
   - **Reason:** IAM provides access decisions (Permit/Deny/Conditional) and user attributes to consuming systems. Each application is responsible for interpreting these decisions and implementing fine-grained access control at the UI or feature level as appropriate.

6. **No Management of External System Credentials or Secrets**
   - IAM does **not** store or manage credentials, passwords, or secrets for external systems, databases, or third-party applications.
   - **Reason:** Secret management for infrastructure, integrations, or applications is delegated to dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., AWS KMS, Vault). IAM only manages credentials relevant to its own authentication flows.

7. **No Product-Specific Attribute or Policy Logic**
   - IAM does **not** define or enforce business-specific logic or workflows (e.g., HR approval flows, document signing processes, project-specific validations).
   - **Reason:** IAM provides a flexible attribute and policy engine, but the definition and enforcement of product-specific logic must be handled by the respective product teams using IAM's APIs and policy outcomes.

### Component Details

- **Auth Gateway**: Handles all authentication flows (password, OTP, SSO, federation), session lifecycle, MFA, and login throttling.
- **Federation Gateway**: Manages inbound (external IdP) and outbound (IAM as IdP) federation, SSO brokering, mapping external claims to internal attributes, and JIT provisioning.
- **Attribute Engine**: Provides dynamic, extensible attribute schema for users and resources; manages custom fields, attribute mapping, and dynamic group rules; supports sync from HR/ERP systems.
- **Policy Engine**: ABAC/RBAC evaluation, policy versioning, real-time policy updates, and caching; supports complex conditions and external context providers.
- **Admin Console**: Web UI for administrators to manage users, groups, attributes, tenants, policies, federation settings, and view audit logs.
- **Audit Service**: Centralized event logging (auth, policy, attribute, federation, admin actions), exports to SIEM/ELK, supports compliance retention and search.
- **Token Service**: Issues, verifies, and revokes JWTs (access, ID, refresh); manages per-tenant signing keys via KMS.
- **SDK Layer**: Official SDKs for major languages (TypeScript, Go, Python) providing login, token, attribute, and policy APIs.
- **DevOps/Platform**: CI/CD, container orchestration, monitoring, alerting, and security scanning.
